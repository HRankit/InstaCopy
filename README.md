## INSTACOPY

The app tries to mimic some of the basic features of Instagram. It uses Network call to Unsplash API along with Pagination library.
This project was made for [#30DaysofKotlin.](https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/kotlin?talk=decodingkotlin) organised by  Google.


## TOPICS

**Topics covered in this project are:**

 1. Null Safety
 2. Single line return functions
 3. Interfaces
 4. Constructors
 5. Companion Objects
 6.  Single statement return function
And others which I do not recall. ;-)


# NOTE 
**API key for Unsplash must be pasted in Utils.kt class. If you try to run the project as it is, the app will crash.**
